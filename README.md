## Theme installation via WordPress Admin Panel

1. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Appearance->Themes
2. Click Add New
3. Click Upload Theme
4. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system.

### Install gulp

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `npm install -g gulp`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://sbtree.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://sbtree.dev"
  }
...
```
